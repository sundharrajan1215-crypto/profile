Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without duplicate characters.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. Note that "bca" and "cab" are also correct answers.
Example 2:

Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
Example 3:

Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
 

Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

Answer:


class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {
        unordered_set<char>st;
        int left=0;
        int Maxlen=0;
        for(int right=0;right < s.length();right++)
        {
            while(st.find(s[right])!=st.end())
            {
                st.erase(s[left]);
                left++;
            }
            st.insert(s[right]);
            Maxlen=max(Maxlen,right-left+1);
        }
        return Maxlen;
    }
};
